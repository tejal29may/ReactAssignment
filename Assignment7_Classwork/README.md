🛒 Excited to share my latest project: a Grocery Bud app built with React! 🌟

🍎 With this app, you can easily manage your grocery lists, add new items, and delete them with just a click.

🔄 Thanks to the power of React hooks - useState and useEffect - the app seamlessly saves your grocery list to localStorage. Here's a breakdown of what I used:

1. **React**: This JavaScript library helped me build a dynamic and interactive user interface for the Grocery Bud app. Its component-based architecture made it easy to organize and manage different parts of the application.

2. **useState Hook**: With the useState hook, I could add state to functional components. In this project, I used it to manage the list of grocery items. Whenever the list changed, React re-rendered the UI to reflect the updates.

3. **useEffect Hook**: The useEffect hook allowed me to perform side effects in functional components. In this case, I used it to synchronize the state of the grocery item list with the data stored in localStorage. This ensured that the list persisted even when the page was refreshed or reopened.

4. **localStorage**: localStorage is a web storage API that allows you to store key-value pairs locally in a web browser. I utilized localStorage to save the grocery item list. By storing the data locally, users could access their grocery lists across sessions without worrying about data loss.
